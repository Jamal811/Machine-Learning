Project Title: Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning with Python

Summary:
In this project, how to build a movie recommendation system in Python. 
The system allows users to input their favorite movie, 
and it recommends similar films based on this input. 
The project covers three main types of recommendation systems: 
content-based, popularity-based, and collaborative filtering. 
Key features include 
data collection and preprocessing, 
feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization, 
and calculating similarity scores with cosine similarity.

Workflow:

Data Collection: Gather movie data including title, genre, cast, and description.
Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values.
Feature Extraction: Convert textual data into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.
Similarity Calculation: Use cosine similarity to assess how closely related movies are.
User Input: Accept userâ€™s favorite movie and recommend similar films based on similarity scores.
This project effectively illustrates the application of machine learning in creating personalized movie recommendations, similar to those used by popular OTT platforms.
