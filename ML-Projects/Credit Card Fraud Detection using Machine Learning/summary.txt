Project Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning in Python

Summary: This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud effectively. 
It utilizes a dataset containing transactions, both legitimate and fraudulent, to train the model. 
Key features include:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and normalizing transaction data to improve model accuracy.
Model Selection: Employing algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods to classify transactions.
Evaluation Metrics: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess model performance.
Implementation in Python: Leveraging libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation and model training.

The project aims to enhance security measures in financial transactions by providing a reliable fraud detection system.
